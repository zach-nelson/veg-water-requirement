Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/zach-nelson/veg-water-requirement/tree/b396e3818079fd4ab48e947b35d736090f37c5ca" target="_blank">b396e38</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>This reproducible R Markdown analysis was created with <code>workflowr</code> (version 1.6.2)[<a href="https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/index.html" class="uri">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/index.html</a>] and <code>targets</code> (version 0.4.2)[<a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/" class="uri">https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/</a>]. The <code>workflowr</code> package sets up a standardized folder structure for Rstudio integration with github version control and provides a set of helper functions to build a github pages static website from Rstudio, commit changes to github, publish updates. The repository can be shared, cloned and improved through pull requests. The <code>targets</code> package provides the data pipeline functions, where upstream changes to files cause only those downstream dependencies to be rerun. Using targets also has the nice byproduct of forcing functional programming habits over imperative programming, which should make the code easier to maintain.</p>
